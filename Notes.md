    1. import UIKit
        1. UI interface
    2. for loop
        1. `for i in 1...8 {}`
            1. i from 1 to 8
        2. `for i in 1..<n+1 {}`
            1. i from 1 to the number that is less than n+1
        3. when i is not used, can replace it with "_" to save symbol
    3. swift is event-driven programming
    4. variable
        1. var in swift is strong type
            1. must have a type, either explicitly or implicitly
                1. `var name:type`
                2. `var name = "an instance here"`
                3. `var name:type = "an instance here"`
        2. var vs. let
            1. var is mutable
            2. let is immutable
    5. Basic Types in Swift

            2. ex: data type, class
        2. Compound type
            1. a type without a name, defined in the Swift language itself
            2. function types
            3. tuple types

           `var president:presType = ("K","J")`
    8. Class
        1. init function has to initialize all stored properties
    9. Printing
        1.  inline
            1.  `print("Last name of the actor is \(actor.lastName) and the SSN Number is \(actor.SSN)")`
        2.  tuples printing
            1.  `print(myTuple.0)`
            2.  give names for elements in tuples
                1.  `myT = (a:"A", ("b","c"))`
                    1.  `print(myT.a)`

    10. Arrays
        1.  `var tm = [Int]()` // initializer syntax
        2.  `var tm:[Int] = []` //cannot be null when appending
        3.  `tm = [1,2,3]`
        4.  `tm.append(4)`
    11. Tuples
        1.  can contain different data types

        8. ==
    2. iterable object / loop
        1. `let names = ["A","B","C","D"]`
           `for name in names {`
           `print("Hello, \(name)!")`
           `}`
        2. `while index < 0 {`
           `print("count is \(index)"`
           `index += 1`
           `}`
        3. `repeat {...}`
           `while (index <5)`
    3. class
        1. one class per file (convention)
        2. `func descrption() -> String {` // a func that        returns a string
           `return "First \(firstName) Last \(lastName)"`
           `}`
        3. `var newP = Person(first:"H",last:"S")` // must indicate argument label
        4. static func printHello() {}
            1. static is class method, not instance needed
            2. `Person.printHello()`
            3. `print(newP.description())`
            4. cannot be overridden

            1. `func example (name:String) {`
               `print("my name is \(name)")`
               `}`
               `example(name:"Bill")`
        3. argument label
            1. `func printName(fn fir:String, ln las:String) {`
               `print("\(las), \(fir)")`
               `}`
            2. `printName(fn:"H",ln:"G")`
                1.  fn is external name, fir is internal name
            3. `func printName( _ fir:String, _ las:String) {`
               `print("\(las), \(fir)")`
               `}`
            4. `printName("H", "G")`
                1. _ as a place holder
            5. `func printName(fn fir:String, ln las:String = "W") {` // give a default value if no value if passed in
               `print("\(las), \(fir)")`
               `}`
            6. `printName(fn:"H", ln:"G")`
               `func retG (pName:String) -> String {`
               `let newG = "Hello, " + pName + "!"`
               `return newG`
               `}`

                    1.  Model
                        1.  consists of objects that encapsulate the data specific to the app
                        2.  defines logic and computations that manipulate and process that data
                    2.  View
                        1.  any object that users can see
                        2.  to display data from the model and enable editing of that data
                        3.  view objects know how to draw themselves and can respond to user actions
                        4.  provide consistency btwn apps
                        5.  multiple views of the same info is possible
                    3. Controller
                        1. intermediary btwn view objects and model objects
                        2. accept input and converts it to commands fro the model or view
                        3. can perform setup and coordinating task for an app and manage the life cycles of objects
                            1. model
                                1. tells the view to change the presentation when there is change in model
                                2. tells the controller when there has been a state change, causing the controller to changes the type of commands available
                            2. View
                                1. request info from the model that it uses to generate output to users
                            3. controller
                                1. interprets user actions made in views and communicate w/ the model to update the model
                                2. when model changes, reflect changes to the view's presentation
                        4. users never directly interact w/ the users

        7. some parts are required some parts are optional
        8. CustomStringConvertible
            1. description()
                1. allow to print object

    3.  Delegate
        1.  one objects acts on behalf of or in coordination with another object
        2.  pointer to some objects that has implemented the protocol's methods
        3.  delegating object keeps a reference to another object (the delegate) and at the appropriate time, sends a message to it
        4.  ex: child refer purchase to mother
    4. Segue
        1. named transition btwn one part of UI to another (move from one VC to another)

            1. serial
            2. only execute one task at a time
            3. the UI can be blocked when you run a heavy task in the main queue
        5.  global dispatch queue
        6.  Quality of Service
            1.  priority of queues
                1. userInteractive
                    1. need to be done immediately for good experience
                    2. small amount of work with low latency
                2. userInitiated
                    1. For tasks that are initiated from the UI and can be performed asynchronously
                3. default
                4. utility
                    1. long-running tasks, typically with a user-visible progress indicator
                5. background
                6. unspecified
        7. create a global queue
            1. `let queue = DispatchQueue.global()`
        8. Create a custom queue named <name>:
            1. `let queue = DispatchQueue(label: <name>, qos: .userInitiated)`
        9. method to use to initiate tasks
            1.  `queueName.sync {<task>}`
            2.  `queueName.async {<task>}`

        1. Basic
            1. Key Value Observing
                1. work w/ class inherits from NSObject
                2. observer for property you want to monitor
                3. have `@objc dynamic` in front of the property bc KVO is implemented in Objective C
                4. observer
                    1. keypath
                        1. `\class.property`
                    2. options
                        1. .new
                        2. .old
                        3. initial
                        4. prior
                    3. closure
                    4. `class Person: NSObject {@objc dynamic var name = "TS"}`
                    5. `let taylor = Person()`
                    6. `taylor.observe(\Person.name, options: .new) {person, change in print ("My name is \(person.name)")}`
        2. Remote
            1. sent by APNS
        3. Scheduled local
        4. User notification
